## How to report.

It's hard to identify a problem without some key parts. What helps??

* Identify the problem. Saying ,It doesn't work, doesn't help much.
* The revision number of three.js
* A small testcase. (Big chance is that when you do this, you'll find the answer yourself.)
* What did you try already??
* Tell us where did you observe the problem: your browser version, your operating system, your graphics card (for example Chrome 23.0.1271.95, Windows 7, Nvidia Quadro 2000M)
* If you can, try to check your problem on multiple browsers / multiple computers (if you are on Windows, especially helpful is to compare ANGLE and OpenGL renderers)
