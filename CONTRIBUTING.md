## How to report a bug?

* The revision number of three.js
* Tell us where did you observe the problem: your browser version, your operating system, your graphics card (for example Chrome 23.0.1271.95, Windows 7, Nvidia Quadro 2000M)
* If you can, try to check your problem on multiple browsers / multiple computers (if you are on Windows, especially helpful is to [compare ANGLE and OpenGL renderers](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-use-OpenGL-or-ANGLE-rendering-on-Windows))
* Identify the problem. Saying "it doesn't work" doesn't help much.
* A small testcase (big chance is that when you do this, you'll find the answer yourself).
* What did you try already?
