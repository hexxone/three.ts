## 2. Before you create a new Issue.

We use both, stackoverflow and github issues. Where should you be posting?

* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js): By default you should be using stackoverflow. Feel free to ask a question whenever you need help either because you're stuck or you don't know what the right approach would be.
* [Github issues](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues): If you're certain that you have found a bug or there is a feature request you would like to make.

For a more extensive explanation, see [issue 1979](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/1979).

### How to report.

It's hard to identify a problem without some key parts. What helps??

* Identify the problem. Saying ,It doesn't work, doesn't help much.
* The revision number of three.js
* A small testcase. (Big chance is that when you do this, you'll find the answer yourself.)
* What did you try already??
