## Having a problem??

We use 2 different systems to have explain problems.

* [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js): This is used when you have a problem in your program. Here we help you out to get further with three.js
* [github issues](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues): This is used to identify problems and features for three.js itself. This is used by the developers of three.js.

If you are not sure which problem you encountered, then we would like to report it to stackoverflow. For a more extensive explanation, see [issue 1979](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/1979).

### How to report??

It's hard to identify a problem without some key parts. What helps??

* Identify the problem. Saying ,It doesn't work, doesn't help much.
* The revision number of three.js
* A small testcase. (Big chance is that when you do this, you'll find the answer yourself.)
* What did you try already??
